# ACS deployment quick guide

Run from the repository root as your normal user. Deployment settings:
`acs-deployment.json`, created from the [example](acs-deployment.example.json).
Source map: [project index](../PROJECT_INDEX.md).

## Setup

```bash
nix shell path:.#acs -c acs shell
# First setup only; preserve an existing local config.
cp acs-k8s/acs-config.example.json acs-k8s/acs-config.json
cp acs-k8s/acs-deployment.example.json acs-k8s/acs-deployment.json
sops modules/secrets/asnk-forge-runner.yaml
acs config show
acs connect
```

Match local registry settings to the deployment image references, and `context`
to an exact SOPS kubeconfig context. Both local JSON files are ignored by Git and
read on each command. The deployment example leaves all runner images empty;
fill them before building a bundle. Keep the example files versioned.
Use `--config FILE` for another profile or `--repo PATH` outside this checkout.

The SOPS document contains `kubeconfig` (complete YAML as a string),
`forgejo.registration-token`, `forgejo.scaler-token`, and
`acr.address`, `acr.namespace`, `acr.username`, `acr.password`.
Scope is **global**: use a global registration token and a separate administrator
queue-reading PAT. SOPS ACR credentials are pull-only and must match local JSON.
The CLI uses an explicit context and a temporary private kubeconfig.
Go owns deployment generation, validation and Kind orchestration; Nix only builds
the CLI and runner images. Use `--deployment FILE` for another deployment JSON.

## Deploy and update

Create ACR repositories `forgejo-runner-{nix,go,node24,docker}`. Publish using
separate push credentials:

```bash
acs registry login
acs images publish           # Append pool names for a subset; "build" skips push
acs registry digests
```

Set every `runners.<pool>.image` to a full image reference, preferably
`REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/forgejo-runner-POOL@sha256:DIGEST`, then:

```bash
acs bundle build
acs bundle inspect
acs bundle snapshots
acs validate platform
acs namespaces
acs secrets apply
acs deploy
acs status
```

For configuration-only updates, repeat bundle build/inspect/snapshots, validation
and deployment; rebuild images only when their contents change. Deployment checks
Secrets, Helm ownership, server validation and readiness. Inspect failures before retrying.

Outputs use `~/.local/state/acs-forgejo` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/acs-forgejo`.
Keep YAML snapshots versioned. Bundle generation uses the embedded pinned KEDA
chart and local Helm; it does not evaluate Nix or contact a cluster.
For existing ESO, use the [template](acs-external-secret-template.yaml) and skip
manual writes to ESO-owned Secrets.

## Pools and containers

| Pool / workflow label | CPU / memory | Max Jobs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nix` / `acs-nix` | 8 / 16 GiB | 10 |
| `go` / `acs-go` | 2 / 4 GiB | 10 |
| `node24` / `acs-node24` | 4 / 8 GiB | 10 |
| `docker` / `acs-docker` | 4 / 8 GiB | 10 |

Pools use amd64 and 30 GiB temporary storage, scaling to zero when idle. KEDA keeps
three components running, each at one replica and 250m CPU / 512Mi requests/limits.

**Add tools:** edit the image package's `extraPackages` in
[`acs-cli.nix`](../modules/apps/acs-cli.nix); publish that image,
update its digest, rebuild and deploy. Shared tools belong in
[`runner-image.nix`](nix/runner-image.nix).

**Add a pool:** add an entry under `runners` in `acs-deployment.json`:

```json
"extra-go": {
  "image": "COPY_THE_EXISTING_GO_POOL_IMAGE_REFERENCE",
  "labels": ["acs-extra-go"],
  "maxReplicas": 10
}
```

Use unique lowercase pool names and bare labels. Omitted settings inherit defaults
(2 CPU / 4 GiB); specify `resources.requests` and `resources.limits` to change them.
Rebuild snapshots, validate and deploy; workflows select `runs-on: acs-extra-go`.
No Nix module or fixed-pool test fixture is needed for another pool. A new image
family still needs its Nix package, ACR repository, CLI image-pool entry and tests.

**Remove a pool:** stop its workflows; in the ACS console annotate its ScaledJob
`autoscaling.keda.sh/paused: "true"` and drain active Jobs. Remove its JSON entry
and rebuild. In `forgejo-runners`, delete that pool's ScaledJob and
TriggerAuthentication `acs-runner-NAME`, plus ConfigMap `acs-runner-NAME-config`;
validate and deploy the remaining bundle. Deployment does not prune live resources.
Keep shared Secrets, ServiceAccount, KEDA and at least one pool. Remove an image
only after all references and Jobs are gone.

## Test and troubleshoot

In a manual Forgejo workflow, use `runs-on: acs-go` with a step
`run: acs workflow test go`; substitute `nix` or `node24` for the other pools.
For `acs-docker`, run `acs workflow test docker` with workflow variables `ACR`,
`TARGET_IMAGE` and push secrets `ACR_USERNAME`/`ACR_PASSWORD`. Create the target
repository first. No checkout is needed; the Buildah test requires Docker Hub.

```bash
acs status                   # All pool conditions/events and recent KEDA logs
acs watch                    # Jobs/pods; Ctrl+C to stop
acs logs POD-NAME
acs validate cli             # Go tests, vet and errcheck
acs validate images          # Nix builds images; Go runs the checks
```

Use `nix run path:.#acs -- status` for the latest CLI. Check scaler failures for
PAT/scope/Secret or DNS/TLS errors; image-pull failures for registry permissions;
pending pods for quotas; restarts for OOM/throttling. Save logs before Job TTL cleanup.
Nix runs without sandboxing; Buildah supports Dockerfile builds, not Docker service
containers/actions. Workflow pods have no Kubernetes token. Offline checks do not
prove live scaling or ACS Buildah compatibility.

Kind bundles are generated by Go from the deployment JSON with isolated overrides.
Run `acs kind probe`, `test`, `network`, `diagnose`; after inspecting the
`acs-k8s/acs-kind-test-report.md`, `acs kind cleanup --yes` removes only owned
fixtures from the existing `kind-acs-test` cluster. Service routing remains a test blocker.
